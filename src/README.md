# why vscode web and codespaces?
Codespaces

    Cloud-based development environment: Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code from anywhere, on any device. It's hosted on Microsoft's servers, so you don't need to worry about setting up and maintaining your own development environment.
    Pre-configured with popular tools and languages: Codespaces comes pre-configured with a variety of popular tools and languages, so you can get started coding right away. This includes support for JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and more.
    Integrated with GitHub: Codespaces is integrated with GitHub, so you can easily create a new Codespace from a GitHub repository, and your changes will be automatically saved back to GitHub.
    Collaboration features: Codespaces includes a number of collaboration features, such as real-time editing and commenting, so you can work on projects with others in real time.

VSCode Web

    Web-based version of VSCode: VSCode Web is a web-based version of VSCode that you can use in your browser. It provides a similar experience to the desktop version of VSCode, but it doesn't require you to install anything on your computer.
    Limited functionality: VSCode Web has some limitations compared to the desktop version of VSCode. For example, it doesn't support all of the same extensions, and it doesn't have the same level of performance.
    Best for quick edits and small projects: VSCode Web is best suited for quick edits and small projects. If you're working on a larger project, or if you need to use more advanced features, you're better off using the desktop version of VSCode.

Which one should you use?

The best choice for you depends on your needs. If you need a cloud-based development environment with all the bells and whistles, Codespaces is the way to go. If you're just looking for a quick and easy way to edit some code, VSCode Web is a good option.
